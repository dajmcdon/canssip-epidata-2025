# Some Words About Forecasting

## Forecasting is not magic

- Forecasts are generally comprised of two parts: trend and seasonality
- Methods for detecting and projecting trends are not magic; in general they're
  not qualitatively that different from what you can do with your eyeballs
- That said, assimilating information from exogenous features (ideally, leading
  indicators) can lead highly nontrivial gains, beyond the eyeballs
- Remember ... good data is just as (more?) important as a good model! 
- Seasonality can help short-term forecasts. Long-term forecasts, absent of 
  strong seasonality, are generally not very tractable

# Linear Regression for Time Series Data

## Basics of linear regression 

* Assume we observe a predictor $x_i$ and an outcome $y_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$.

* Linear regression seeks coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ such that

$$y_i \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$

is a good approximation for every $i = 1, \dots, n$.

* In R, the coefficients are found by running `lm(y ~ x)`, where `y` is the vector 
of responses and `x` the vector of predictors.


## Multiple linear regression 

* Given $p$ different predictors, we seek $(p+1)$ coefficients such that

$$y_i \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \dots + \beta_p x_{ip}$$
is a good approximation for every $i = 1, \dots, n$.


## Linear regression with lagged predictor


* In time series, outcomes and predictors are usually indexed by time $t$. 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
* [Goal]{.primary}: predicting future $y$, given present $x$. 

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
* [Model]{.primary}: linear regression with lagged predictor

$$\hat y_t = \hat \beta + \hat \beta_0 x_{t-k}$$

i.e. regress the outcome $y$ at time $t$ on the predictor $x$ at time $t-k$.

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
* [Equivalent]{.primary} way to write the model: 

$$\hat y_{t+k} = \hat \beta + \hat \beta_0 x_t$$

:::

## Example: predicting COVID deaths  

* During the pandemic, interest in predicting COVID deaths 7, 14, 21, 28 days ahead.

* Can we reasonably [predict COVID deaths 28 days ahead]{.primary} by just using cases today?


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
* If we let

$$y_{t+28} = \text{deaths at time } t+28 \quad\quad x_{t} = \text{cases at time } t$$
  is the following a good model?

  $$\hat y_{t+28} = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_{t}$$

## Note

[Cases]{.primary} seem [highly correlated]{.primary} with [deaths]{.primary}
several weeks later (but [relation]{.primary} cases-deaths [changes]{.primary} over time).
:::

## Checking correlation


* Let’s split the data into a training and a test set (before/after 2021-04-01).

* On training set: [large correlation]{.primary}
between cases and deaths 28 days ahead (> 0.95).

```{r correlation-cases-deaths}
t0_date <- as.Date('2021-04-01') #split date

train <- ca |> filter(time_value <= t0_date)
test <- ca |> filter(time_value > t0_date)

t0 <- nrow(train)  #split index

# look at cases and deaths (where we move deaths forward by 1, 2, ..., 35 days)
lags = 1:35
cor_deaths_cases <- lapply(
  lags, 
  function(x) epi_cor(train, deaths, cases, cor_by = geo_value, dt1 = x)
)

cor_deaths_cases <- list_rbind(cor_deaths_cases, names_to = 'Lag') 

#k <- which.max(cor_deaths_cases$cor)
k <- 28 # selected lag

cor_deaths_cases |>
  ggplot(aes(Lag, cor)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = k, color = base) +
  geom_point(color = primary) +
  geom_line(color = primary) +
  labs(x = "Lag", y = "Correlation") +
  ggtitle('Correlation between cases and deaths by lag')
```

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
* Let's use (base) R to prepare the data and fit 

$$\hat y_{t+28} = \hat\beta + \hat\beta_0 x_{t}$$

:::

## Preparing the data

```{r lag-cases}
#| echo: true
ca$lagged_cases <- dplyr::lag(ca$cases, n = k)     # Add column with cases lagged by k
t0_date <- as.Date('2021-04-01')                   # Split into train and test (before/after t0_date)
train <- ca |> filter(time_value <= t0_date)
test <- ca |> filter(time_value > t0_date)
```

Check if `deaths` is approximately linear in `lagged_cases`:

```{r plot-lag-cases}
ggplot(train, aes(lagged_cases, deaths)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5, color = primary, shape = 16) +
  labs(x = "Cases", y = "Deaths 28 days later")
```

## Fitting lagged linear regression in R

```{r lagged-lm}
#| echo: true
reg_lagged = lm(deaths ~ lagged_cases, data = train)
coef(reg_lagged)
```

```{r plot-linear-fit}
ggplot(train, aes(lagged_cases, deaths)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5, color = primary, shape = 16) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = base) +
  labs(x = "Cases", y = "Deaths 28 days later")
```

# Evaluation

## Error metrics

* Assume we have predictions $\hat y_{new, t}$ for the unseen observations 
$y_{new,t}$ over times $t = 1, \dots, N$.

* Four commonly used error metrics are:

  * mean squared error (MSE)

  * mean absolute error (MAE)

  * mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)

  * mean absolute scaled error (MASE)

## Error metrics: MSE and MAE

$$MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N (y_{new, t}- \hat y_{new, t})^2$$
$$MAE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N |y_{new, t}- \hat y_{new, t}|$$

* MAE gives less importance to extreme errors than MSE.

* [Drawback]{.primary}: both metrics are scale-dependent, so they are not universally 
interpretable.
(For example, if $y$ captures height, MSE and MAE will vary depending on whether we measure in feet or meters.)

## Error metrics: MAPE

* Fixing scale-dependence:

$$MAPE = 100 \times \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N 
\left|\frac{y_{new, t}- \hat y_{new, t}}{y_{new, t}}\right|$$

* [Drawbacks]{.primary}:

  * Erratic behavior when $y_{new, t}$ is close to zero

  * It assumes the unit of measurement has a meaningful zero (e.g. using 
Fahrenheit or Celsius to measure temperature will lead to different MAPE)

## Comparing MAE and MAPE

::: {.callout-important}
There are situations when MAPE is problematic!

## Error metrics: MASE

$$MASE = 100 \times \frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N 
|y_{new, t}- \hat y_{new, t}|}
{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{t=2}^N 
|y_{new, t}- y_{new, t-1}|}$$

* [Advantages]{.primary}:

  * is universally interpretable (not scale dependent)

  * avoids the zero-pitfall

* MASE in words: we normalize the error of our forecasts by that of a naive method 
which always predicts the last observation.

## Defining the error metrics in R

```{r error functions}
#| echo: true
MSE <- function(truth, prediction) {
  mean((truth - prediction)^2)}

MAE <- function(truth, prediction) {
  mean(abs(truth - prediction))}

MAPE <- function(truth, prediction) {
  100 * mean(abs(truth - prediction) / truth)}

MASE <- function(truth, prediction) {
  100 * MAE(truth, prediction) / mean(abs(diff(truth)))}
```

## Estimating the prediction error

* Given an error metric, we want to estimate the prediction error under that metric. 

* This can be accomplished in different ways, using the

  * Training error

  * Split-sample error

  * Time series cross-validation error (using all past data or a trailing window)


## Training error

* The easiest but [worst]{.primary} approach to estimate the prediction error is 
to use the training error, i.e. the average error on the training set that was 
used to fit the model.

* The training error is

  * generally too optimistic as an estimate of prediction error

  * [more optimistic the more complex the model!]{.primary}^[More on this when we talk about overfitting.]


## Training error

#| echo: true

```{r function errors}
getErrors <- function(truth, prediction, type) {
  data.frame(
    #"MSE" = MSE(truth, prediction), 
    "MAE"= MAE(truth, prediction), 
    #"MAPE" = MAPE(truth, prediction), 
    "MASE" = MASE(truth, prediction), 
    row.names = type
  )
}
```


```{r training-error}
errors <- getErrors(train$deaths[-(1:k)], pred_train, "training")
errors
```



## Split-sample error 

To compute the split-sample error  

  1. [Split]{.primary} data into training (up to time $t_0$), and test set (after $t_0$)

  1. [Fit]{.primary} the model to the [training]{.primary} data only

  1. Make [predictions]{.primary} for the [test]{.primary} set

  1. Compute the selected [error]{.primary} metric on the [test]{.primary} set only


::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Note

Split-sample estimates of prediction error don't mimic a situation where we 
would refit the model in the future. 
They are [pessimistic]{.primary} if the relation between outcome and predictors 
changes over time.
:::

## Split-sample MSE 

Assume we want to make $h$-step ahead predictions, i.e. at time $t$ we want to 
make a forecast for $t+h$. Then, the split-sample MSE is

$$\text{SplitMSE} = \frac{1}{n-h-t_0} \sum_{t = t_0}^{n-h} (\hat y_{t+h|t_0} - y_{t+h})^2$$

where	$\hat y_{t+h|t_0}$ indicates a prediction for $y$ at time $t+h$ that was made 
with a model that was fit on data up to time $t_0$.



## Split-sample error
#### Linear regression of COVID deaths on lagged cases

```{r test-pred}
#| echo: true
# Getting h-step ahead predictions for the test set
h <- k
test_h <- test[-(1:h-1), ] # drop first h-1 rows to avoid data leakage
pred_test <- predict(reg_lagged, newdata = test_h)
```

```{r plot-test-predictions}
#| fig-width: 7

                                          rep(NA, h-1), pred_test)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(predicted, observed), names_to = 'Deaths') |>

  scale_alpha_identity() +
  scale_color_delphi()
```


```{r test-error}
errors <- rbind(errors, getErrors(test$deaths, pred_test, "split-sample"))
errors
```

::: {.notes}
Note that we are overestimating the peak due to the changed relationship 
between cases - deaths over time.

Talk about data leakage.
:::

## Warning!

* [Predictions]{.primary} are [overshooting]{.primary} the target, 
especially in early 2022 ([Omicron]{.primary} phase).

* This is because we are predicting [deaths]{.primary} using [lagged cases]{.primary}, 
but the [relation]{.primary} between 
the two [changes]{.primary} over time.

```



## Time-series cross-validation (CV)
#### $h$-step ahead predictions

* If we [refit]{.primary} in the future once new data are available, a more 
appropriate way to estimate the prediction error is time-series cross-validation.

* To get $h$-step ahead predictions, for each time $t = t_0, t_0+1, \dots$,

  * [Fit]{.primary} the model using data [up to time $t$]{.primary}

  * Make a [prediction for $t+h$]{.primary} 

  * Record the [prediction error]{.primary}

* The cross-validation MSE is then

$$CVMSE = \frac{1}{n-h-t_0} \sum_{t = t_0}^{n-h} (\hat y_{t+h|t} - y_{t+h})^2$$

where	$\hat y_{t+h|t}$ indicates a prediction for $y$ at time $t+h$ that was made 
with data available up to time $t$.

## Time-series cross-validation (CV) 
#### Linear regression of COVID deaths on lagged cases

## Regression on a trailing window

* [Fit the model on a window of data of length $w$]{.primary}, 
starting at $t-w$ and ending at $t$.

* [Advantage]{.primary}: if the predictors-outcome relation changes over time,
training the forecaster on a window of recent data can better capture the recent 
relation which might be more relevant to predict the outcome in the near future.

* Window length [$w$]{.primary} considerations: 

  * <span class="inner-list">if $w$ is too [big]{.primary}, 
  the model [can't adapt]{.primary} to the 
  recent predictors-outcome relation </span>

# ARX models

## Autoregressive exogenous input (ARX) model

* [Idea]{.primary}: predicting the outcome via a linear combination of its lags 
and a set of exogenous (i.e. external) input variables

* Example:

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat\phi + \sum_{i=0}^p \hat\phi_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{j=0}^q \hat\beta_j x_{t-j}$$

* [Notice]{.primary}: we don't need to include all contiguous lags, and we could fit e.g.

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat \phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\phi_1 y_{t-7} + \hat\phi_2 y_{t-14} +
\hat\beta_0 x_{t} + \hat\beta_1 x_{t-7} + \hat\beta_2 x_{t-14}$$


## ARX model for COVID deaths

* Let's add lagged deaths as a predictor to our previous forecaster: 

$$\hat y_{t+28} = \hat\phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\beta_0 x_{t}$$

* We will refer to this model as [ARX(1)]{.primary}, as it only includes one lag for each predictor.

```{r arx-lm}
#| echo: true
# Prepare data: add column with deaths lagged by 28
ca$lagged_deaths <- dplyr::lag(ca$deaths, n = k)
```

* How does it compare to the previous model in terms of time-series CV?

## Note

From now on, we will only consider regression on a [trailing window]{.primary},
since regression on all past data leads to overshooting during Omicron.

## Warning!

* At the [forecast date]{.primary} when the downward dip in deaths is predicted, 
the coefficients estimated by [ARX(1)]{.primary} are

```{r check-issue-trailing}
#which(pred_trailing == 0)
t_issue = 503 #502, 503
all_past = lm(deaths ~ lagged_deaths + lagged_cases, data = ca, subset = (1:n) <= t_issue) 
trailing = lm(deaths ~ lagged_deaths + lagged_cases, data = ca, 
                    subset = (1:n) <= t_issue & (1:n) > (t_issue-w)) 

coef(trailing)
```


* The downward dip is explained by the [negative coefficient on `lagged_cases`]{.primary}, 
and by the fact that at the forecast date

  * observed deaths are exactly equal to 0 (data issue)

  * observed cases are increasing



## Predictions for different $h$

* So far we only focused on COVID death predictions 28 days ahead.

* We will now compare the model with lagged cases as predictor

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat\beta + \hat\beta_0 x_t$$

to the ARX(1) model

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat\phi + \hat\phi_0 y_t + \hat\beta_0 x_t$$

for [horizons $h = 7, 14, 21, 28$]{.primary}.

* We will only make forecasts on the $1^{st}$ day of each month, and use a trailing window with $w = 120$.

# Overfitting and Regularization

## ARX models with 2 and 3 lags

* The [ARX(1)]{.primary} model 
$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat \phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\beta_0 x_{t}$ 
has good predictive performance

* We will now try to improve the ARX(1) model by including [more lags]{.primary} in the set of predictors

* Let's consider two extensions: the [ARX(2)]{.primary} model

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat \phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\phi_1 y_{t-7} + 
\hat\beta_0 x_{t} + \hat\beta_1 x_{t-7}$$

and the [ARX(3)]{.primary} model

$$\hat y_{t+h} = \hat \phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\phi_1 y_{t-7} + \hat\phi_2 y_{t-14} +
\hat\beta_0 x_{t} + \hat\beta_1 x_{t-7} + \hat\beta_2 x_{t-14}$$

and fit them using a trailing window with $w = 120$.

## Warning!

As we add more predictors, [forecasts]{.primary} seem more [volatile]{.primary} and errors increase.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## **Overfitting**
:::

## Overfitting

When we introduce [too many predictors]{.primary} in the model

* The estimated coefficients will be chosen to mimic the observed data very 
  closely on the training set, leading to [small training error]{.primary}

* The predictive performance on the test set might be very poor, 
  producing [large split-sample and CV error]{.primary}



## Extreme case: ARX model with 120 predictors

* What happens if we increase the number of predictors to 120? 

* Let's fit

$$\hat y_{t+28} = \hat\phi + \hat\phi_0 y_{t} + \hat\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + 
\hat\phi_{59} y_{t-59} + 
\hat\beta_0 x_{t} + \dots + \hat\beta_{t-59} x_{t-59}$$

Some predictions were negative, which doesn't make sense for count data, so we truncated them at 0.

## Back to ARX(1), ARX(2), and ARX(3)

How can we 

* select the "right" number of lags to include? 

* avoid overfitting, while considering a large number of predictors? 


## Regularization

* [Idea]{.primary}: introduce a regularization parameter $\lambda$ that [shrinks or sets]{.primary} some 
of the estimated coefficients to zero, i.e. some predictors are estimated to 
have limited or no predictive power

* Most common regularization methods

  * [Ridge]{.primary}: shrinks coefficients to zero
  
  * [Lasso]{.primary}: sets some coefficients to zero


* Let's predict $h=28$ days ahead by regularizing

  * ARX(1)
  * ARX(2)
  * ARX(3)

# Prediction Intervals

## Point predictions vs intervals 

* So far, we have only considered [point predictions]{.primary}, i.e. 
we have fitted models 
to provide our [best guess on the outcome]{.primary} at time $t+h$. 

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## 
What if we want to provide a [measure of uncertainty]{.primary} around the point 
prediction or a [likely range of values]{.primary} for the outcome at time $t+h$?

:::

* For each target time $t+h$, we can construct [prediction intervals]{.primary}, i.e. provide 
ranges of values that are expected to cover the true outcome value a fixed 
fraction of times.

## Prediction intervals for `lm` fits

* To get prediction intervals for the models we previously fitted, 
we only need to tweak our call to `predict` by adding as an input: 

  `interval = "prediction", level = p`

  where $p \in (0, 1)$ is the desired coverage.

* The output from `predict` will then be a matrix with 

  * first column a [point estimate]{.primary}
  
  * second column the [lower limit]{.primary} of the interval
  
  * third column the [upper limit]{.primary} of the interval


## Prediction intervals for ARX (CV, trailing window)

```

## Expected vs actual coverage

* We would [expect]{.primary} the ARX model to [cover]{.primary} the truth
about [80\%]{.primary} of the times. Is this actually true in practice?

* The actual coverage of the predictive intervals is [lower]{.primary}:

```{r lm-coverage-all-past}
data.frame("Actual" = round(mean(ca$deaths >= lm_pred_trailing$lower & 
                                   ca$deaths <= lm_pred_trailing$upper, na.rm = T), 2),
           "Expected" = 0.80,
           row.names = "Coverage")
```

* We can use [calibration]{.primary} to handle under-covering (more on this in the afternoon)

# Other Approaches to Time Series Data

## Traditional Time Series Forecasting

Two popular frameworks:

* Exponential Smoothing with Trend and Seasonality ([ETS]{.primary})

* Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ([ARIMA]{.primary})


## ETS

### Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)

* The $h$-step ahead prediction is a weighted average of the current 
observation $y_t$ and the forecast $\hat y_{t|t-1}$:

$$\hat y_{t+h|t} = \alpha y_t + (1- \alpha) \hat y_{t|t-1}$$

where $\alpha \in [0,1]$

* [Forecasts are flat]{.primary}, i.e. do not depend on $h$

* If $\alpha = 1$, we retrieve the [naive flatline]{.primary} forecaster

$$ y_{t+h|t} = y_t$$


## ETS

### Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)

* The SES forecast can be re-expressed as

$$\hat y_{t+h|t} = \alpha y_t + \alpha (1- \alpha) y_{t-1}  + \alpha (1- \alpha)^2 y_{t-2} + \dots$$

i.e. observations [$y_{t-k}$]{.primary}  that are $k$ steps into the past are [exponentially 
down-weighted]{.primary}, with weight $(1- \alpha)^2$. Hence the name exponential smoothing.

* [Component form]{.primary} of the SES forecast

\begin{align*}
\hat y_{t+h | t} & = l_t \\
l_t & = \alpha y_t + (1- \alpha) l_{t-1}
\end{align*}

## ETS

### Holt's linear trend method

* Expands SES component form by introducing a [trend]{.primary} $b_t$

\begin{align*}
\hat y_{t+h | t} &= l_t + b_t h\\
l_t &= \alpha y_t + (1- \alpha) (l_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\
b_t & = \beta (l_{t} - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}
\end{align*}

where $\alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$.

* [Forecasts are linear]{.primary} in $h$, with slope $b_t$.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Note

Linear trend forecasts can be erratic for large $h$!
:::


## ETS

### Damped Holt's method

* Introduces a parameter $\phi$ to [dampen the forecast trajectory]{.primary} 

\begin{align*}
\hat y_{t+h | t} &= l_t + b_t (\phi +\phi^2 + \dots + \phi^h)\\
l_t &= \alpha y_t + (1- \alpha) (l_{t-1} + b_{t-1}\phi) \\
b_t & = \beta (l_{t} - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}\phi
\end{align*}

where $\alpha, \beta, \phi \in [0,1]$

* Contribution of slope $b_t$ to a forecast diminishes at each step into the 
future, by a multiplicative factor $\phi$

* As $h\to \infty$, forecasts approach a constant level

$$ y_{t+h | t} \to l_t + b_t \sum_{j=1}^\infty \phi^j = l_t + b_t \frac{\phi}{1-\phi}$$

## ARIMA

### AR(p)

Auto-regressive model of order $p$

$$y_t = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j y_{t-j} + w_t$$

### MA(q)

Moving average model of order $q$

$$y_t = w_t + \sum_{j=1}^q \theta_j w_{t-j} $$

where $w_t$ is a white noise sequence, i.e. 
$\mathbb{E}(w_t)=0$ and $\text{Var}(w_t)=\sigma^2$ for all $t$, and 
$\text{Cov}(w_s, w_t)=0$ for all $s \neq t$


## ARIMA

### ARMA(p, q)

$$y_t = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j y_{t-j} + \sum_{j=0}^q \theta_j w_{t-j} $$

with $\theta_0 = 1$

### ARIMA(p, d, q)

Assumes an $ARMA(p, q)$ model on the 
$d^{th}$-order differences of $y_t$

## Mechanistic Models
