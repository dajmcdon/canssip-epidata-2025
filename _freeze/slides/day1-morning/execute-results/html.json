Versioning in `{epidatr}`\n\n\n# The Delphi Research Group\n\n## About Delphi\n\n* Founded in 2012 at Carnegie Mellon University, now expanded to UC Berkeley, and University of British Columbia.\n\n* Currently 5 faculty, ~10 PhD students, ~15 staff (mostly software engineers).\n\n* Easy to join us from anywhere (lots of volunteers during Covid-19 pandemic).\n\n* We are:\n    + CDC Center of Excellence for Influenza and Covid-19 Forecasting (2019-24).\n    + CDC Innovation Center for Outbreak Analytics and Disease Modeling (2024-29).\n\n[**Our mission:**]{.primary} To develop the theory and practice of [epidemic detection, tracking and forecasting]{.primary}, and their use in decision making, both public and private.\n\n## What does Delphi do?\n\n* Procure [real-time, aggregated data streams]{.primary} informative of infectious diseases and syndromes, in collaboration with partners in industry and government.\n\n* Extract signals and make them widely available via the [Epidata platform & API]{.primary}.\n\n* Develop and deploy algorithms for [epidemic detection, tracking, forecasting]{.primary}.\n\n* Develop and maintain statistical software packages for these tasks.\n\n* Make it all production-grade, maximally-accessible, and open-source (to serve CDC, state and local public health agencies, epi-forecasting researchers, data journalists, the public)\n\n## What we provide\n\n![](gfx/web_of_parts.svg){fig-align=center}\n\n# Workshop Overview and System Setup\n\n## A few slides here\n\n## A few slides here\n\n## System setup -- Passive viewing\n\n<br>\n\n### All of the slides are at \n\n<br>\n\n[<https://cmu-delphi.github.io/insightnet-workshop-2024>]{style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n<br>\n\n### The source code is in the Repo \n\n<br>\n\n<https://github.com/cmu-delphi/insightnet-workshop-2024>\n\n<br>\n\nThis is enough, but we hope you'll want to work through the code as we go along.\n\n<br>\n\n[Detailed versions of the next few slides are shown at the Repo Link above.]{.secondary}\n\n## System setup -- Required software \n\n<br>\n\n### We assume you already have\n\n<br>\n\n1. `R`\n\n<br>\n\n2. An IDE. We'll use RStudio, but you can use VSCode or Emacs or Whatnot\n\n## System setup -- Downloading the materials\n\n### Easy way: \n\n1. Click the [Big Green Button]{.fourth-colour} that says <kbd>< > Code ▾</kbd>\n2. Choose [Download Zip]{.primary}\n3. Open the Zip directory and then Open `insightnet-workshop-2024.Rproj`\n\n### More expert (local `git` user):\n\n1. Click the [Big Green Button]{.fourth-colour} that says <kbd>< > Code ▾</kbd>\n2. Copy the URL.\n3. Open RStudio, select File > New Project > Version Control. Paste there and proceed.\n\n### Even more expert (wants `github` remote):\n\n1. Click the Grey Button that says <kbd>⑂ Fork ▾</kbd>\n2. Proceed along the same lines as above.\n\n## System setup -- Installing required packages\n\nWe will use a [lot]{.tertiary} of packages.\n\n### We've tried to make it so you can get them all at once (with the right versions)\n\n🤞 We hope this works... 🤞\n[Note that you can \"Copy to Clipboard\"]{.fourth-colour}\n\n<br>\n\nIn RStudio:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"pak\") # good for installing from non-CRAN sources\npak::pkg_install(\"cmu-delphi/InsightNetFcast24\", dependencies = TRUE)\nInsightNetFcast24::verify_setup()\n```\n\n<br>\n\nHopefully, you see:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n✔ You should be good to go!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAsk for help if you see something like:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `verify_setup()`:\n!
