CDC's own NSSP, NWSS\n    + Be the national historical repository of record & preserve the raw data\n\n2. **Be the national clearinghouse for epi-signals, including those held elsewhere**\n    + The go-to place for signal discovery\n\n3. **Add value to existing signals and synthesize new ones**\n    + Added value: see next slide\n    + Synthesize new: via signal fusion, e.g. nowcasting\n\n4. **Be the focal point for community-wide efforts to open up privately held data**\n    + Better positioned than government or industry\n</div>\n\n\n## The bigger goal\nThe goal is to make epi-surveillance [more nimble, complete, standardized, robust, and real-time]{.primary} and\n\n[less burdensome on the health system itself]{.primary}. \n\nEpidata is not the solution; but we hope it is a blueprint towards such a solution.\n\n\n## What is the Epidata repository\n\n[**Epidata**]{.primary} is a repository of aggregated epi-surveillance time series. To the full extent we can, we make everything [free and open-source]{.primary}.\n\n* To date, it has accumulated over 5 billion records (each record is the value of a signal, at a particular date, and a particular location).\n\n* At the peak of the pandemic, we were receiving millions of API queries per day.\n\n* [**Data comes from**]{.primary}: public health reporting, medical insurance claims, medical device data, Google search queries, wastewater, app-based mobility patterns.\n\n* Many of our data streams simply aren't available anywhere else.\n\n* [**Added value we provide**]{.primary}: revision tracking, anomaly detection, trend detection, smoothing, imputation, geo-temporal-demographic disaggregation\n\n## Features of Delphi Epidata\n\n* Built-in support for:\n    + Data revisions (\"backfill\").  Concepts of \"reporting date\" and \"as of\".\n    + Backfill projection and alerting to changes in backfill dynamics\n    + Geo levels w/ auto-aggregation: county, MSA, HRR, state, HHS region, nation\n        - Also esoteric ones: DMA, sewer sheds\n    + Demographic breakdown\n    + Representation for missingness and censoring\n    + Population sizes and fine-grained population density\n    \n* Pre-computed smoothing and normalization (customization planned)\n\n* Access control\n\n* Code is Open Source.

vs private methods\n\nAside from these public methods we've gone through (these start with `pub_`),\nthere are private methods (these start with `pvt_` when you type `avail_endpoints()`).\nThese require private access keys to use (separate from the Delphi Epidata API key). \nTo run these locally, you will need to store these secrets in your `.Reviron` file, or set them as environmental variables.\nSee [Private methods](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/articles/signal-discovery.html) for examples of using private endpoints.\n:::\n\n## Signal metadata\n\n* Some endpoints provide

geography types. \n\n* Key Endpoints for Metadata\n    + `pub_covidcast_meta()`: Access metadata for the COVIDcast endpoint.\n    + `pub_fluview_meta()`: Get metadata for the FluView endpoint.\n    +

estimate, location, date, and update timeline.\n\n* Requesting Specific Data Versions:\n    + Use `as_of` or `issues` arguments to specify data availability.\n    + Use `as_of` to fetch one version
