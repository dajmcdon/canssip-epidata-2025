## Schedule

In this workshop, we plan to demonstrate how to use R to load, process, 
inspect, and forecast aggregate epi surveillance data. We will be presenting a 
few case studies to motivate the entire pipeline from signal discovery to the 
production of nowcasts and forecasts. 

1. [Lecture 1](slides/lecture1.qmd): Introduction to Panel Data
1. [Lecture 2](slides/lecture2.qmd): Data Cleaning, Versioning, and Nowcasting
1. [Lecture 3](slides/lecture3.qmd): Compartmental Models, Renewal Equations, and $R_t$ Estimation
1. [Lecture 4](slides/lecture4.qmd): Forecasting and Advanced Topics

[Worksheet](worksheet/index.qmd)
